"Automating the practice of science: Opportunities, challenges, and implications","Automation transformed various aspects of our human civilization, revolutionizing industries and streamlining processes. In the domain of scientific inquiry, automated approaches emerged as powerful tools, holding promise for accelerating discovery, enhancing reproducibility, and overcoming the traditional impediments to scientific progress. This article evaluates the scope of automation within scientific practice and assesses recent approaches. Furthermore, it discusses different perspectives to the following questions: where do the greatest opportunities lie for automation in scientific practice?; What are the current bottlenecks of automating scientific practice?; and What are significant ethical and practical consequences of automating scientific practice? By discussing the motivations behind automated science, analyzing the hurdles encountered, and examining its implications, this article invites researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders to navigate the rapidly evolving frontier of automated scientific practice."
Random Forests for Heteroscedastic Data,"Random forests are a popular machine learning technique that are effective across a range of scientific problems. We extend the standard algorithm to incorporate the uncertainty information that arises in heteroscedastic data - datasets where the amount of noise in the target value varies between datapoints. We consider datasets where the relative amount of measurement noise in different datapoints is known. This is not the standard scenario, but does commonly exist in real data, as we illustrate on 10 drug design datasets. Utilising this uncertainty information can lead to significantly better predictive performance. We introduce three random forest variations to learn from heteroscedastic data: parametric bootstrapping, weighted random forests and variable output smearing. All three can improve model performance, demonstrating the adaptability of random forests to heteroscedastic data and thus expanding their applicability. Additionally, variations in the relative performance of the three methods across datasets provides insight into the mechanisms of random forests and the purpose of the different random elements within the model."
Genesis: Towards the Automation of Systems Biology Research,"The cutting edge of applying AI to science is the closed-loop automation of scientific research: robot scientists. We have previously developed two robot scientists: `Adam' (for yeast functional biology), and `Eve' (for early-stage drug design)). We are now developing a next generation robot scientist Genesis. With Genesis we aim to demonstrate that an area of science can be investigated using robot scientists unambiguously faster, and at lower cost, than with human scientists. Here we report progress on the Genesis project. Genesis is designed to automatically improve system biology models with thousands of interacting causal components. When complete Genesis will be able to initiate and execute in parallel one thousand hypothesis-led closed-loop cycles of experiment per-day. Here we describe the core Genesis hardware: the one thousand computer-controlled -bioreactors. For the integrated Mass Spectrometry platform we have developed AutonoMS, a system to automatically run, process, and analyse high-throughput experiments. We have also developed Genesis-DB, a database system designed to enable software agents access to large quantities of structured domain information. We have developed RIMBO (Revisions for Improvements of Models in Biology Ontology) to describe the planned hundreds of thousands of changes to the models. We have demonstrated the utility of this infrastructure by developed two relational learning bioinformatic projects. Finally, we describe LGEM+ a relational learning system for the automated abductive improvement of genome-scale metabolic models."
